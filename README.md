# bihalofit_cpp
C++ object-oriented implementation of the BiHalofit code (Ryuichi Takahashi et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.07886) - A fitting formula of the non-linear matter bispectrum (http://cosmo.phys.hirosaki-u.ac.jp/takahasi/codes_e.htm )

Simply add the bihalofit.hpp and bihalofit.cpp file to your project, create a bihalofit object and then use the functionalities of bihalofit

For a quick test, you can run the 'main.cpp' file provided here by executing the following commands:

g++ main.cpp bihalofit.cpp -o test

./test
